## Developer Notes

While this app is Xamarin based and in theory cross platform, I'm only able to provide the application for Android, due to a lack of hardware.

If you are an iOS developer and would like to work with me on an iOS release, please contact me. My contact details can be found on my [website](https://mjurtz.com/).
